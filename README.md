# password-checker

Project Description
The Password Strength Checker is a Python script designed to evaluate the strength of a user's password based on several criteria. It ensures that the password meets essential security standards, such as length and character diversity, helping users create strong, secure passwords.

The script checks if the password:

Is at least 8 characters long
Contains both uppercase and lowercase letters
Includes at least one digit
Contains at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*()-_+=)
This project is ideal for learning basic Python programming, and user input validation.

Features
Length Validation: Password must be at least 8 characters long.
Uppercase/Lowercase Check: Ensures the password contains both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Digit Check: Validates the inclusion of at least one number.
Special Character Validation: Confirms that at least one special character is included.
